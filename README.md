_infinite Escher_

[Apeiron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron_(cosmology)) is a Greek word
meaning "boundless", "infinite", or "indefinite", etymologically stands
for "without limit".

I prepared the [escher.xcf](escher.xcf) file (Gimp format) a long time ago because
I wanted to achieve seamlessly repeatable background image based on the
illusion of endless stairs. I've never used it, but while reviewing archive of old files
I decided to make something more creative out of it. Check it out:

The image is draggable. You can explore it. It should also adjust to any
screen size.

It is based on the [Ascending and Descending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_and_Descending)
lithograph by [M. C. Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher)
 
I used this library:

You can find the whole code deployed as GitHub Pages in the `gh-pages` branch.
